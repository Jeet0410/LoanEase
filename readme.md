## Project Overview
LoanEase is a modular, CLI-based **loan amortization simulator** that empowers users to explore repayment schedules, what-if scenarios (extra payments, rate shocks), and export results in CSV/PDF formats. Built with a test-driven development approach, LoanEase emphasizes accuracy, reliability, and maintainability.
